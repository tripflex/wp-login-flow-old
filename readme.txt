Require users to activate via email using the default WordPress password reset.

== Description ==

Use this plugin to require users to activate their email address, and then set their password once email has been activated.  This will replace the default wp_new_user_notification which normally emails the user with their password.

Once you activate this plugin it will instead send them an email similar to the password reset email, with a link to the default password reset page to set their password.

= Features =

* Require Email Activation
* Users set password after activation
* Uses default WordPress password reset

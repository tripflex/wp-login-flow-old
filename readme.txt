Complete WP Login (wp-login.php) flow control.  Customize wp-login.php, require users to activate email, custom email templates, custom rewrite (login, register, activate), and more!

== Description ==

WP Login Flow is only plugin that will solve all of your wp-login needs.  Complete customization of the default wp-login.php page, with many other advanced features such as requiring users to activate their account via email, custom rewrite permalinks for all wp-login links, ability to force using custom permalinks instead of wp-login.php links (ie /register instead of wp-login.php?action=register), responsify the wp-login.php page, custom logo, link, background, login box, and more!

This plugin was created to keep things as clean, simple, and useful as possible.  The main bread and butter is the user email activation, which is integrated with the default password reset page.  What this means is users are required to "Activate" their account by using a link in the email to set their password.  Everyone knows email is insecure, so why would you ever email a user their password?  This plugin solves that problem, and helps you keep both you and your users safe.
